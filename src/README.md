======
Angular project code.

### /app
Directory for most angular app components.  These can be organized by the suggestions at: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub) or [http://blog.angularjs.org/2014/02/an-angularjs-style-guide-and-best.html](http://blog.angularjs.org/2014/02/an-angularjs-style-guide-and-best.html) and [http://toddmotto.com/opinionated-angular-js-styleguide-for-teams/](http://toddmotto.com/opinionated-angular-js-styleguide-for-teams/)

Directory for most shared components of your application.  Directives and services used across the angular app would make more sense to go here (but can still be organized in their respective component directories)

### index.html
The root html file of your application
