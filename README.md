##gulp-ng-skel

A basic skeleton setup for angular projects that combines the convenience of bower module installation with an easy-to-edit gulp build chain.

### Getting started
Make sure that you have bower and gulp installed

```
npm install -g bower
npm install -g gulp
```

Then install any bower/npm dependencies

```
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, you can build the project with

```
gulp build
```

Other than that, running just `gulp` from the command line will show you other build options


### Layout

#### /src
All of your angular code and assets.  These can be organized by whatever ng best practices you subscribe to. Read more in that directory.

#### /vendor
Third-party javascript libraries.
